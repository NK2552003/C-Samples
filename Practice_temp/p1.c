/*As we already know that what is variable and what are keywords let us start with our first program*/
#include <stdio.h> // # is the preprocessor which is used to include any library at which we'll work
//stdio.h -> is the standard input output header file (functions like printf, scanf are included in this type of header file)
//program execution starts from main
//as stated earlier, words like int, printf, scanf, return etc are called keywords

int main()
{
    printf("Hello world\n"); // '\n' is used to print the next files in new line
    return 0; //to let the program stay neutral we used return and as int function should return a value
}
